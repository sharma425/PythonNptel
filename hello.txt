and I'm working as an assistant
00:10
professor in the department of computer
00:11
science at Utrecht and Open University
00:13
Hall Duany and I am your instructor for
00:16
this money today we will discuss history
00:18
of Internet and after studying this
00:21
module you should be able to understand
00:24
the history and evolution of Internet
00:26
know the advantages of packet switching
00:29
networks explain the reason why ARPANET
00:32
was designed defined the role of
00:34
Internet browsers explain Internet
00:37
addresses know the functions of DNS
00:40
understand Internet infrastructure and
00:44
understand World Wide Web the Internet
00:48
has grown so rapidly and become
00:50
indispensable so quickly that it can be
00:53
hard to remember that it is still a
00:55
fairly new medium most people use the
00:58
Internet daily for personal and
01:00
increasingly for business purposes
01:01
childrens are growing up with online
01:04
activities as a second nature even in
01:07
rural and lower-income communities
01:09
opportunities for Internet users are
01:11
spreading individuals go to the internet
01:14
for information employment education and
01:17
ailment relationships and support it has
01:21
facilitated our life in more than one
01:24
way have you ever wondered from where
01:26
the internet came let us discuss the
01:29
brief history of Internet and learn how
01:31
this internet was invented and how it
01:34
evolved to an extent that now we cannot
01:37
think of our lives without it so we will
01:39
start our discussion with the historical
01:41
perspective of the internet I don't know
01:45
what the cold war between USA and Russia
01:47
gave to the world but definitely the
01:49
Internet is one of those very useful
01:52
inventions whose foundation was laid
01:54
during cold war days Russia launched the
01:57
world's first satellite Sputnik into the
02:00
space on 4th of October 1957 this was
02:03
clearly the victory of Russia over the
02:05
cyberspace and as a counter step ARPA or
02:09
Advanced Research Projects Agency the
02:13
arm of Department of Defense United
02:15
States declared the launch of ARPANET or
02:18
Advanced Research Project agency Network
02:21
in early 1960s this was an experimental
02:25
network and was designed to keep the
02:28
computers connected to this network to
02:31
communicate with each other even if any
02:33
of the node due to the bomb attack fails
02:36
to respond the first message was sent
02:39
over the ARPANET a packet switching
02:41
network by Leonid clean rock laboratory
02:45
at university of california los angeles
02:48
you will be surprised to know that the
02:50
first message that was sent over
02:52
internet was letter L Oh actually they
02:56
intended to send word login but only the
03:00
first two letter reached its destination
03:02
at second network node at a Stanford
03:06
Research Institute and before the last
03:08
three letters could deduce the
03:10
destination the network was down due to
03:13
a glitch sure the error was fixed and
03:16
the message was recent the major tasks
03:20
that our Pinet have to play is to
03:22
develop rules for communication that is
03:25
protocols for communicating over ARPANET
03:28
the ARPANET in particular led to the
03:31
development of protocols for internet
03:34
working in which multiple separate
03:36
networks could be joined into a network
03:39
of networks it resulted in the
03:42
development of tcp/ip protocol sue which
03:45
specifies the rules for joining and
03:48
communicating over ARPANET soon after in
03:52
1986 NSF or National Science Foundation
03:56
backbone was created and five US
03:59
universities computing centers were
04:01
connected to form NSF net the
04:04
participating universities were
04:06
Princeton University Cornell University
04:10
University of Illinois Carnegie Mellon
04:14
University and General Atomics San Diego
04:17
supercomputer Center an affectionate the
04:20
successor of ARPANET became popular by
04:24
1990s
04:26
ARPANET was decommissioned in 1965
04:29
Donnell Davis and his colleagues at the
04:31
UK National Physical Laboratory
04:34
independently discovered the idea of
04:36
packet switching and later created a
04:39
small-scale packet switching version of
04:41
ARPANET Michigan educational research
04:45
information dried found merit networks
04:48
in 1966 which was funded and supported
04:51
by state of Michigan and the National
04:53
Science Foundation France also developed
04:56
a packet switching network known as
04:58
Cyclades in 1973 now there were many
05:02
parallel systems working on different
05:04
protocols and the scientists were
05:06
looking for some common standards so
05:09
that networks could be interconnected in
05:12
1978 tcp/ip protocols were ready and by
05:16
1983 the tcp/ip protocol were adopted by
05:20
ARPANET in 1981 the integration of two
05:24
large network took place NFS developed
05:27
computer science network which is known
05:29
as CS net and was connected to ARPANET
05:32
using tcp/ip protocols you now the
05:35
network was not only popular among the
05:37
research community but the private
05:39
players also took interest in the
05:40
network NFS supported speed of 56
05:43
kilobytes per second it was upgraded to
05:47
1.5 megabits per second in 1988 to
05:51
facilitate the growth of network by
05:54
involving merit network IBM MCA and
05:58
state of Michigan after the corporate
06:01
realized the strength and merit of this
06:03
network they participated in the
06:05
development of the network to write its
06:07
benefits by late 1980s many Internet
06:11
service providers emerged to provide the
06:14
backbone for carrying the network
06:15
traffic by 1991 NFS net was expanded and
06:20
was upgraded to 45 megabits per second
06:23
many commercial ISPs provided backbone
06:26
service and was popular among the
06:28
corporates on 30th April 1995 the NSFNET
06:33
backbone service has been successfully
06:36
ported to a new architecture and
06:38
that NSFNET backbone was decommissioned
06:41
now the internet could carry commercial
06:44
traffic now more and more universities
06:45
and research centers throughout the
06:48
world were connected to it this network
06:50
was very popular among the research
06:52
community and in 1991 national research
06:56
and education network known as NR en was
07:00
founded and the World Wide Web was
07:02
released initially the role of Internet
07:05
was only limited to file transfer the
07:08
credit of Internet what we see today
07:10
goes to Tim berners-lee who introduced
07:13
world wide web with the advent of www
07:17
there was a transformation on how the
07:19
network was used
07:20
now this web of information can be used
07:22
to retrieve any information available
07:25
over the Internet software called
07:27
browser was developed to browse the
07:29
Internet it was developed by researchers
07:31
at the University of Chile noise in 1992
07:35
and named as Mo's act
07:36
there's browsers enabled to browse the
07:38
internet the way we browse it today with
07:42
so many devices connected to the
07:43
Internet we require some mechanism to
07:46
uniquely identify every device that is
07:48
connected to the Internet for sending a
07:51
data packet from source computer to
07:53
destination computer on a network it is
07:55
required that both nodes have their own
07:58
unique address we also require some
08:00
centralized system which take care of
08:03
this mechanism so that the signs which
08:05
are used to identify each device are not
08:08
duplicate else the whole purpose is
08:10
defeated to take care of this we have a
08:13
centralized Authority known as internet
08:16
assigned numbers Authority which is
08:18
responsible for assigning a unique
08:20
number known as IP or Internet Protocol
08:24
address an IP address is a 32-bit binary
08:27
number which is divided into four
08:30
octaves and each octet consists of eight
08:33
binary digits and these updates are
08:35
separated by a dot each eight bits in
08:38
the octet can have two binary values
08:41
that is zero and run therefore each
08:45
octet can have minimum value of zero
08:47
that is eight zeros to maximum value 250
08:51
that is all once and in total we have to
08:55
raise to power 8 that is 256 different
08:58
combinations again to remember this
09:01
32-bit addresses in binary is bit
09:04
difficult so for better understanding of
09:07
a human being it is expressed in a
09:09
decimal format but this decimal format
09:12
is for human understanding only and the
09:14
computer understand it in binary format
09:16
in decimal the above IP addresses
09:19
expressed as 120 3.45 dot 78 dot 125
09:25
these octets are used to create and
09:28
separate different classes an IP address
09:31
consists of two parts that is network
09:34
and host network part identifies a
09:37
particular network among different
09:39
networks and the host part identifies a
09:42
device of a particular network this
09:45
address uniquely identifies a devices
09:47
connected to the Internet
09:49
similar to the postal system where we
09:51
identify any house by first identifying
09:54
the country then state followed by
09:57
district post office cluster or block
10:01
and finally the house number the system
10:03
of IP address classes was developed for
10:06
the purpose of internet IP addresses
10:09
assignment the class is created where
10:12
based on the network size for example
10:15
for a small number of networks with the
10:17
very large number of hosts the Class A
10:20
was created the Class C was created for
10:23
the numerous networks with the small
10:26
number of hosts these IP addresses are
10:29
classified into five categories based on
10:31
the availability of IP range these
10:33
categories are Class A B C D and E each
10:39
class has a range of valid IP addresses
10:41
the value of the first octant determined
10:44
the class IP addresses from the first
10:48
three classes that is a B and C can be
10:51
used for host addresses the other two
10:54
classes are used for other purposes that
10:56
is Class D for multicast and Class E for
11:00
experimental purposes in Class A IP
11:03
addresses the
11:05
work ideas a bit long and the host idea
11:08
is 24 bits long
11:09
it has 128 network IDs and approximately
11:14
16 million hosts IDs IP addresses
11:17
belonging to Class A ranges from 0 dot 0
11:21
dot 0 dot 0 to 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 in
11:28
Class B IP addresses the network ID is
11:32
16 bit long and the host ID is 16 bit
11:36
raw it has 16384 network addresses and
11:42
65535 host addresses IP addresses
11:46
belonging to Class B ranges from 128 dot
11:49
0 dot 0 dot 0 to 191 dot 255 dot 0 dot 0
11:55
in Class C IP addresses the network ID
11:59
is 24 bits long and the host ID is 8
12:02
bits now it has approximate 2 million
12:06
Network addresses and 254 host addresses
12:09
IP addresses belonging to Class C ranges
12:13
from 192 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 to 223 dot
12:17
255 dot 255 dot 0 IP addresses plumbing
12:22
to Class D ranges from 220 4.0 dot dot 0
12:26
to 239 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 and IP
12:33
addresses of Class E ranges from 240 dot
12:37
0 dot 0 dot 0 to 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot
12:42
255
12:43
I am a decentralized the task of
12:47
assigning the IP addresses by allocating
12:49
the large chunk of IP addresses to five
12:52
regional internet registries which are
12:54
further responsible to allocate the IP
12:57
addresses in their zone
12:59
these are IRS our APN IC f Ric and I see
13:04
a rin LHC and IC and our IP and CC APN
13:11
IC is responsible for serving the
13:14
asia-pacific region F Ric n IC
13:19
is responsible for serving the African
13:21
reason a Rin responsible for serving
13:24
North America and several Caribbean and
13:26
North Atlantic island la CNIC is
13:30
responsible for serving Latin America
13:32
Caribbean and our IPE and Cici is
13:36
responsible for serving Europe Middle
13:38
East and parts of Central Asia for
13:41
listening and coordination between these
13:43
five our IRS there is a organization
13:46
called number resource organization or
13:50
NRO whenever we browse any website in
13:53
the internet we type name something like
13:56
www dot you or you got a seedot in we
13:59
really live with IP addresses like one
14:02
zero 4.28 dot 2.90 but the fact is even
14:07
if we type the IP address in the URL it
14:10
will land us to the same webpage the
14:12
fact is we are very comfortable using
14:15
and remembering the names instead of
14:17
numbers moreover these IP addresses
14:20
changes over time and some of these
14:22
sites have multiple IP addresses also
14:25
the transfer of data over Internet is
14:27
only possible using IP addresses because
14:30
the routing of the packet of data sent
14:32
over Internet is done using IP address
14:35
there is a server called domain name
14:38
system or DNS which ex care of this
14:41
translation job to simplify and to save
14:45
us from remembering these changing IP
14:47
address numbers whenever you type in
14:50
address like w-w-w dot u u dot s e dot M
14:54
there is a process called DNS name
14:57
resolution takes place in the background
15:00
the computer gives the track of recently
15:03
visited sites and locally maintains our
15:05
database in DNS cache in case the IP
15:11
address of the site you have requested
15:13
for is not found in the DNS cache of
15:16
your local computer then the next
15:19
probable place to find it as DNS server
15:22
of your internet service provider or ISP
15:26
these DNS servers of isp also maintains
15:29
the cache of the recently visited pages
15:32
just in case the information is not
15:34
found here also the DNS server of the
15:37
ISP forward the query to the root
15:40
nameservers the root nameservers
15:43
published the root zone file to other
15:45
DNS servers and clients on the Internet
15:48
the root zone file describes where the
15:51
authority of servers of the DNS
15:53
top-level domain or TLD are located
15:57
there are currently 30 group name
16:00
servers which are listed here
16:02
these root names are worse directs the
16:04
query to the appropriate top-level
16:06
domain names or words by reading the
16:09
last part of the URL first in our
16:11
example the URL was www dot u dot dot n
16:17
the last part is in some of the example
16:21
of TLD name servers are comm dot Bills
16:25
dot orgy dot u s dot n etc these TLD
16:31
name servers act as a switch port and
16:33
direct the query to the appropriate
16:35
authority of name server maintained by
16:38
each domain authority name server
16:41
maintains DNS record along with other
16:43
useful information this address record
16:46
is returned back to the requesting host
16:48
computer via names our word ISP DNS
16:51
server intermediate REE servers keep the
16:54
record of this IP address can there be
16:56
in a sketch so that if the same request
16:59
is encountered again they don't have to
17:02
go through this process again if the
17:04
same URL is requested again the DNS
17:07
cache of the local host computer will
17:09
return the IP address of the URL
17:11
Internet as the name suggests is a
17:14
network of networks that is it is a
17:17
collection of several small medium and
17:19
large networks this clearly indicates to
17:23
one fact nobody is a single owner of the
17:25
internet and it is one of the proven
17:28
example of collaborative success now you
17:31
must be surprised how such a large
17:33
network which is spread across the
17:36
continents can jump without any problem
17:39
yes it is correct that to monitor such a
17:41
large network we require an
17:43
international body which
17:45
can frame the rules regulations and
17:48
protocols to join and use this network
17:50
therefore an international organization
17:53
known as the Internet Society was formed
17:57
in 1992 to pay care of such issues let
18:02
us now discuss how this internet works
18:04
how the email you sent to your friend is
18:07
received by your friends computer
18:09
located at another country or continent
18:12
then you are working in your computer in
18:14
your home without connecting to the
18:17
internet your computer is a standalone
18:19
system but whenever you connect to the
18:21
Internet by dialing to your internet
18:24
service provider using your modem you
18:27
become a part of the network the ISP is
18:30
the link between the Internet backbone
18:32
through which the entire data route and
18:34
the user the ISP connects to the
18:38
Internet backbone ad network access
18:40
points on nap these naps are provided by
18:44
the large telecommunication companies at
18:46
various reasons these large
18:48
telecommunication companies connect the
18:51
countries and the continents by building
18:53
and maintaining the large backbone
18:55
infrastructure to room data from nap to
18:58
lab is peas are connected to this
19:01
backbone at nap and are responsible to
19:04
build and manage network locally so when
19:06
you dial internet through modem you
19:09
first become a part of the local ISP
19:11
which interns connect to the internet
19:14
backbone through nap the data is routed
19:17
through this backbone and sent to the
19:19
destination nap where the ISP of your
19:22
friends network is located as soon as
19:25
your friend dies his modem to connect to
19:28
the internet the data is delivered to
19:30
your friend's computer sometimes we
19:33
interchangeably use the term internet
19:35
and world wide web or simply the web as
19:39
it is popularly known as but web is only
19:43
one of the several utilities that
19:45
Internet provides some of the popular
19:48
service that Internet provides other
19:50
than web is email Usenet messaging
19:54
service FTP etc the web use HTTP
19:58
protocol
19:59
to communicate over Internet and to
20:01
exchange information the web was
20:04
developed at CER n by a UK scientists in
20:08
berners-lee in 1989 it consists of all
20:12
the public websites and all the devices
20:15
that access the web content www is an
20:19
information sharing model which is
20:22
developed which in information over the
20:24
Internet there are plenty of public
20:26
website which is a collection of the
20:29
pages available over the Internet these
20:32
web pages contain plenty of information
20:34
in the form of text video audio and
20:37
picture foreign these web pages are
20:40
assessed using a application software
20:42
called a web browser some of the example
20:45
of popular web browsers are Internet
20:47
Explorer Chrome Safari Firefox etc now
20:51
we will discuss about Internet in
20:54
details the internet stands for
20:56
interconnection of computer networks it
20:59
is a massive heterogeneous combination
21:01
of millions of computers network devices
21:05
smartphone devices all connected by
21:07
wires and wireless signals there are
21:11
different definitions of Internet but
21:13
the meaning is the same
21:14
some of the popular definitions are the
21:17
first definition is the series of
21:19
interconnected network allowing
21:22
communication of data surrounded by
21:24
millions of computer worldwide the
21:27
second definition is a global
21:29
communication network that allows
21:31
computers worldwide to connect and
21:34
exchange information and the third
21:36
definition is a worldwide system of
21:39
computer network a network of networks
21:42
in which users at any one computer can
21:46
get information from any other computer
21:49
although it started in 1960s as a
21:52
military experiment in communication the
21:55
internet evolved into a public free
21:58
broadcast forum in the 70s and 80s
22:01
no single Authority owns or control the
22:04
Internet although there are companies
22:07
that help out to manage different parts
22:09
of the net
22:10
that ties everything together we use the
22:14
term Internet and World Wide Web
22:17
interchangeably but they are different
22:19
let us now discuss how is the internet
22:22
different from World Wide Web in 1989 a
22:26
large subset of the Internet was
22:28
launched as a World Wide Web the web is
22:31
a massive collection of HTML pages that
22:34
transmits through the Internet's
22:36
hardware
22:37
you will hear expression web 1.0 web 2.0
22:41
and the invisible web to describe these
22:44
billions of web pages the web is one
22:48
software application or service that run
22:51
on the Internet it is a collection of

22:59
huge range of information that is stored
23:02
on computers around the world the
23:05
expressions web and Internet are used
23:07
interchangeably by a layperson this is
23:10
technically incorrect as the web is
23:13
contained by the Internet
23:14
now let us quickly discuss what is web
23:17
1.0 web 2.0 and the invisible web we
23:23
will start with web 1.0 when the World
23:26
Wide Web was launched in 1989 by tim
23:30
berners-lee it was comprised of just
23:33
text and simple graphics as a collection
23:35
of electronic brochures the web was
23:38
organized as a simple broadcast receive
23:41
formal we call this simple static format
23:43
as web 1.0 today millions of web pages
23:47
are still quite static and the term web
23:50
1.0 still applies in the late 1990s the
23:55
web started to go beyond aesthetic
23:57
contents and begin offering interactive
23:59
services instead of just web pages as
24:03
brochures the web begin to offer online
24:06
software where people could perform

the invisible web is the third part of
24:45
the world while web technically a subset
24:48
of web 2.0 the invisible web described
24:52
those billions of the pages that are
24:54
purposely hidden from regular search
24:56
engines these invisible web pages are
24:59
private confidential pages and web page
